# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sebastian, a Computer Science student and working student Software Developer.  
I have hands-on experience with C, C++, Java, and Angular (HTML, CSS, TypeScript), mainly focusing on the basics and essentials as I continue to expand my skill set.

I am passionate about learning more about computer science, IT, and technology in general.  
In my free time, I enjoy bouldering and working on projects with my 3D printer.

I'm always eager to explore new technologies, deepen my knowledge, and take on new challenges!
